    <h2>The Buoy</h2>
    <p>The buoy is a yellow stuff that stay at the sea. It collects data and it is a good place to see the sunset.</p>

    <h2>The Sunset</h2>
    <p>If you have a vessel and 3 free day, you can go to the buoy just to watch the sunset.
    The problem is the weather. If you have big waves and strong winds, it is not safe to go to the buoy just to watch the sunset.
    However, if you are an adventure person, I recomend you to do that. It is an incredibloe experience!</p>
    <h2>The Vessel</h2>
    <p>The vessel is the white stuff in the behind the buoy. It is just a thing used to go to the sea and deploy buoys.</p>
